This is a Windows Service that is started when the system is booted. It will shut down the computer if it has been started and running for a set amount of time, but noone has logged in.

If a user logs in, the service is stopped.

This is a counter-measure to my cats starting my desktop computer by walking on the case during the night, but not shutting it down afterwards (rude).
